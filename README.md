# PS1 BRender Games Assets

### Extracted assets of PS1 BRender games (textures, 3D models, animations, etc).

> Documentation & scripts: [PS1-BRender-Reverse](https://github.com/OverSurge/PS1-BRender-Reverse).

I also upload the assets on this Drive : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EuWQUAjVnBeOHMQkKf9IjBAiNgYil8CG

The levels are too large for GitHub, you can find them on the Drive for now (I will have to upload them elsewhere soon as the Drive is nearly full).
